            <p>
              In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the
              languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext
              Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for
              design.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML
              and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables
              by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by
              building a quiz site.

            <p>
              Now that you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, level up
              your skills by learning some of the most popular front end
              libraries in the industry.
            </p>

            <p>
              Later, you'll build a shopping cart and other applications to
              learn how to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with
              React and Redux.

          >
            <p>
              Until this point, you've only used JavaScript on the front end to
              add interactivity to a page, solve algorithm challenges, or build
              an SPA. But JavaScript can also be used on the back end, or
              server, to build entire web applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, one of the popular ways to build applications is through
              microservices, which are small, modular applications that work
              together to form a larger whole.

            <p>
              Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript
              including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge
              by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize
              numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space
              Station.
            </p>

            <p>
              Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles
              or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional
              Programming (FP).
